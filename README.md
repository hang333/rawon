## About this fork

**Rawon Libre is the AGPL-3.0 open source continuation of [Rawon](https://github.com/stegripe/rawon).**

On 2026-05-04 the upstream project relicensed from **AGPL-3.0** to **CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0** — a licence
that is not open source, forbids commercial use, and forbids derivative works. This fork continues
the project from [`a1b0ef7`][fork-point], the last commit ever published under AGPL-3.0, and will
stay AGPL-3.0.

### What that means in practice

- Everything up to and including [`a1b0ef7`][fork-point] is upstream work released under AGPL-3.0.
  Copyright remains with Stegripe Development and the original contributors — that licence grant is
  irrevocable, which is precisely why this fork is possible.
- **No code from upstream commits after [`a1b0ef7`][fork-point] is included here, and none will be
  merged.** Those commits are CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 and are incompatible with this project.
- Where upstream has since fixed a bug or added a feature, it is reimplemented independently from a
  description of the behaviour. Upstream's implementation is not copied, adapted, or consulted
  line-by-line.
- Contributions are welcome and are accepted under AGPL-3.0. Please do not submit patches derived
  from post-relicence upstream code.

[fork-point]: https://github.com/stegripe/rawon/commit/a1b0ef7e66e6dced13608ad9fc13cfa953441c55

## Features
- Production-ready, no coding required
- Request channel feature for seamless music experience
- Support for YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Bilibili, and direct files
- Run multiple bot instances for different voice channels
- Smart audio pre-caching for smoother playback
- Built-in Google login via Puppeteer for cookie management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version `20.0.0` or higher
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for audio processing

> **Note**: Docker users don't need to install FFmpeg manually — it's included in the Docker image.

### Standard Setup (Node.js)
1. Download and install the prerequisites above
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values (at minimum: `DISCORD_TOKEN`)
4. Install dependencies:
```sh
pnpm install
```
5. Build the project:
```sh
pnpm run build
```
6. Start the bot:
```sh
pnpm start
```
7. (Optional) After the bot is online, set up a dedicated music channel:
```
<prefix>requestchannel <#channel>
```
Example: `!requestchannel #music-requests`

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

#### Using Docker Compose
1. Create a `.env` file with your configuration (copy from `.env.example`)
2. (Optional) Create `dev.env` for additional settings
3. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:
```yaml
services:
  rawon-libre:
    image: ghcr.io/hang333/rawon-libre:latest
    container_name: rawon-libre-bot
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
      - dev.env
    ports:
      - "${DEVTOOLS_PORT:-3000}:${DEVTOOLS_PORT:-3000}"
    volumes:
      - rawon-libre:/app/cache

volumes:
  rawon-libre:
```
4. Start the bot:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```
5. View logs:
```sh
docker logs -f rawon-libre-bot
```

#### Using Docker Run
```sh
docker run -d \
  --name rawon-libre-bot \
  --env-file .env \
  -p "${DEVTOOLS_PORT:-3000}:${DEVTOOLS_PORT:-3000}" \
  -v rawon-libre:/app/cache \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/hang333/rawon-libre:latest
```

#### Volume Information
The `/app/cache` volume stores:
- `yt-dlp` binary for audio streaming
- `data.*` for persistent settings (request channels, player states)
- Cached audio files (if audio caching is enabled)
- Cookie file and profile data from Google login (see [Cookies Setup](./docs/COOKIES_SETUP.md))

#### Port Information
The `DEVTOOLS_PORT` (default: `3000`) is used for Chrome DevTools remote debugging proxy. This is required for `!login start` to work from a remote machine. Set `DEVTOOLS_PORT` in your `dev.env` file to use a different port.

## Configuration Files
- `.env.example` - Essential settings (Discord/Spotify token, prefix, IDs, etc.)
- `dev.env.example` - Optional developer settings (prefix/slash toggles, sharding, DevTools, debug mode, etc.)
- Bot-specific settings (embed color, yes/no emoji, splash, alt prefix, default volume, selection type, audio cache) are managed via the `setup` command (developer-only) and stored in the database. Use `setup view` to list available settings.

Use the ones you need/should and fill in the values.

### Multi-Bot Mode

Multi-bot mode is adaptive - no extra configuration needed!

- **Single token** = Single bot mode
- **Multiple tokens (comma-separated)** = Multi-bot mode automatically enabled

Example for multi-bot:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN="token1, token2, token3"
```

Features:
- The first (order) token becomes the primary bot for general commands
- Each bot handles music commands for users in its voice channel
- Adaptive ordering - if the primary bot is not in a server, the next available bot takes over
- Each bot requires its own Discord application

## Documentation
- [Disclaimers](./docs/DISCLAIMERS.md) - Important legal information
- [Cookies Setup](./docs/COOKIES_SETUP.md) - Fix "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" errors on hosting providers

### Common Issues

**"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" errors?**

If you're hosting on cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Railway, etc.), you may encounter bot detection errors. See [Cookies Setup](./docs/COOKIES_SETUP.md) for the solution.

**Quick fix using the login command:**
```
!login start    # Opens a browser for Google login
!login status   # Check current login & cookie status
!login logout   # Clear the login session (wipes all cookies and profile data)
```

Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hang333/rawon-libre/issues) for bugs and questions
about this fork. Do not direct questions about Rawon Libre to the upstream project — it is a
separate, independently maintained codebase.
